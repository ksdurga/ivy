# Summary

You will be creating an application that tracks daily workout activities. The app will consist of these three core elements:

Workouts, each of which has a name and date associated with it; as well as an unlimited amount of Activities.
Activities: these are the parts of each workout. Each activity consists of an Exercise (Barbell Curl, Lateral Curl, Bench Press, Treadmill, Stairmaster, etc.) and then info about Duration, Weight, Sets, Reps, and Distance.

Example: Bob's workout for Feb 20 consisted of these Activities:

Barbell Curl, Weight: 50 Sets: 5 Reps: 5

Stairmaster: Duration: 30 minutes Distance: 50 flights

The list of Exercises can be entered directly into Mongo.

MOST of the client side functionality will be provided. Focus on the back-end.

You will NOT be reloading the index.html page in order to update state. You'll be dynamically updating the DOM, but most of this will be done for you.

You'll be using Express Router this time, and you'll map your routes to controllers, which will then reference Mongoose models. You'll be provided with one example of this.

You'll use:
Node
MongoDB
Mongoose
Express & Express Router
jQuery and Bootstrap
Bonus Points:
Develop a seeder file that seeds the exercises instead of you putting them in manually.
More Bonus Points:
Your seeder file can also seed a few initial workouts.
